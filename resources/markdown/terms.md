# Terms of Service

By using this service, you consent to cookies being stored on your device which are essential to the operating of the service (Strictly necessary cookies)

By paying for use of the service, we, Manchester Disc Golf agree to run the BagTags according to our agreed policy, distribute a physical tag to every playing member and run a finale event later in the year, COVID permitting. 
By using the app, you accept these terms.
We may make changes to these terms with no prior warning, please check back to see if any changes have been made.

We may suspend use of the web app service for business or operational reasons, but as the app is a non-essential add-on to the paid physical bag-tag service this will not affect your statutory rights or entitle you to a refund of any monies paid.

Donations made to the Lilford Park fundraiser as part of the service will be non-refundable and binding.

This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.
